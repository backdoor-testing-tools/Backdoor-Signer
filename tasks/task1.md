# Task 1: Custom Programming Language Design and Implementation

## Overview
Design and implement a custom programming language for the application inside the terminal integration. The language must integrate with Python and Swift, providing a seamless programming experience within the terminal environment.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use existing files in the codebase. Do not create placeholder files. Access necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code and replace with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue sequentially, providing a complete fix before proceeding.
- **Repository Analysis**: Thoroughly examine every file in the codebase. Base changes on a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies listed in `dependencies.md` to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Evaluate logic critically, ensuring implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.

## Specific Requirements

### Python Integration
- Enable writing, executing, and coding in Python
- Support installing Python dependencies, running scripts, and performing Python-related tasks
- Provide full access to Python's librarys and ecosystem

### Swift Integration
- Enable writing, executing, and running Swift code
- Include support for command-line tools and native iOS APIs
- Provide full access to Swift's capabilities and language features

### Interoperability
- Allow switching between Python and Swift within the same program
- Support data passing between Python and Swift
- Maintain state and context when switching between languages

### Terminal Enhancement
- Enhance the terminal interface to support the custom language
- Provide a user-friendly environment for code input and execution
- Implement proper error handling and reporting

### Language Features
- Define a clear, user-friendly syntax for the custom language
- Support variables, control flow, and function definitions
- Include language constructs for seamless switching between Python and Swift

### Optimization
- Ensure the implementation is efficient and optimized for iOS
- Implement secure execution environments for both languages
- Note that the application is not subject to App Store restrictions

## Implementation Steps
1. Design the language syntax and create a formal specification
   - Define how language switching works
   - Specify syntax for data passing between languages
   - Document language constructs and features

2. Develop an execution engine to parse and run the custom language
   - Integrate Python and Swift runtimes
   - Implement the parser for the custom language
   - Create an execution context manager for handling state

3. Enhance the terminal interface to support the new language
   - Add syntax highlighting if possible
   - Implement command history for language-specific commands
   - Add auto-completion for common language constructs

4. Use open-source libraries from `dependencies.md` for interoperability
   - Leverage any suitable libraries for language processing
   - Use available tools for Python and Swift integration

5. Provide a complete solution including:
   - Language design documentation
   - Execution engine implementation
   - Terminal UI enhancements
   - Example programs demonstrating language features

## Expected Deliverables
- Full implementation of the custom programming language
- Enhanced terminal interface supporting the new language
- Documentation of language syntax and features
- Example programs demonstrating key capabilities

## Notes
- The language should be intuitive enough for users familiar with either Python or Swift
- Error reporting should be clear and helpful
- Performance is important but secondary to functionality
- Security considerations should be addressed, especially for code execution

### Code Snippet
- This is a example of how of user should be allowed todo
- This Code Snippet is only a example dont define the code around it directly
- The following code snippet demonstrations how a code example of something a user can execute and it should work without a issue.

- # Swift + Python Mix:

This file demonstrates a `DrawingViewController` that combines Swift for UIKit-based UI and drawing, and Python for button logic and interaction handling.

```swift
// DrawingViewController.swift
import UIKit
// Hypothetical import for Python interoperability
import PythonBridge // Assumed module for Swift-Python integration

class DrawingViewController: UIViewController {
    // UI Elements (Swift)
    private var canvasView: CanvasView!
    private var colorButton: UIButton!
    private var clearButton: UIButton!
    
    // Python handler for button logic
    private var pythonHandler: PythonBridge.PythonObject!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setupUI()
        setupPythonHandler()
    }
    
    // Setup UI with Swift
    private func setupUI() {
        view.backgroundColor = .white
        
        // Canvas for drawing
        canvasView = CanvasView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 100, width: view.frame.width, height: view.frame.height - 200))
        view.addSubview(canvasView)
        
        // Color button
        colorButton = UIButton(frame: CGRect(x: 20, y: 50, width: 100, height: 40))
        colorButton.setTitle("Change Color", for: .normal)
        colorButton.backgroundColor = .blue
        colorButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(colorButtonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)
        view.addSubview(colorButton)
        
        // Clear button
        clearButton = UIButton(frame: CGRect(x: view.frame.width - 120, y: 50, width: 100, height: 40))
        clearButton.setTitle("Clear", for: .normal)
        clearButton.backgroundColor = .red
        clearButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(clearButtonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)
        view.addSubview(clearButton)
    }
    
    // Initialize Python handler
    private func setupPythonHandler() {
        // Hypothetical bridge to load Python code
        pythonHandler = PythonBridge.loadPythonModule("drawing_logic")
    }
    
    @objc private func colorButtonTapped() {
        // Call Python function for color change
        pythonHandler.change_color(canvasView)
    }
    
    @objc private func clearButtonTapped() {

// Custom CanvasView for drawing
class CanvasView: UIView {
    private var lines: [[CGPoint]] = []

    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        guard let touch = touches.first else { return }

        lines[lines.count - 1] = currentLine
        setNeedsDisplay()
    }
    
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        guard let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext() else { return }
        context.setLineWidth(2.0)
        
        for line in lines {
            context.setStrokeColor(currentColor.cgColor)
            guard let firstPoint = line.first else { continue }
            context.move(to: firstPoint)
            for point in line.dropFirst() {
                context.addLine(to: point)
            }
            context.strokePath()
        }

    // Expose method to Python for clearing
    func clear() {
        lines.removeAll()
